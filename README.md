# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This analysis is being conducted to prepare a company for an impending wave of retirements in their workforce.  Our goal is to identify those workers who are on their
way out and determine eligible candidates who would fit in a mentorship program that would prepare the next generation to fill their shoes.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
