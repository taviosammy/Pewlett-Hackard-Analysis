# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This analysis is being conducted to prepare a company for an impending wave of retirements in their workforce.  Our goal is to identify those workers who are on their
way out and determine eligible candidates who would fit in a mentorship program that would prepare the next generation to fill their shoes.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

  - 1510 of 72458 people eligible to retire are also eligible to be mentors
  - Only 0.2% of retiring Senior Engineers are eligible to mentor.
  - Neither of the retiring Managers are eligible to mentor. 
  - Assistant Engineers have the highest percentage of eligibility for the program at 6%.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

- 72,458 of the 371,243 staff will need replacing assuming all operations remain the same.  That's 19.5% of the current workforce.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Consider 72,458 staff members are eligible for retirement yet only 1510 are mentorship-ready. That's a 1:48 ratio of mentor to mentee.  It will be more up to 
the level of training required for each job title to decide if this number of mentors is enough to properly replace the silver tsunami but a basic eye test of the data would suggest their are not enough mentors.  Senior Engineers would need special attention given only 0.2% of the 25,916 people who are retirement-ready are also mentorship-ready.
